- improve cycle
- "Complexity of the problem is rather in the data than in the code that you write"
- underfit: network not powerful enough to represent the patterns in the data
- overfit: network memorizes every detail incl. noise and errors

how do you know if network overfits or underfits:
while training monitor:
    - training error - errors the model makes on the training set
        - should go down with more data
        - should be close to predicted human error rate
        - large gap between training error and human error > bias problem
    - dev error - errors on the development set
        - gap between training & dev error > variance problem
        - focus more on generalization of the model (e.g. add regularisation or drop out)
        - when dev error increases again > overfitting
            - stop training or
            - add additional regularisation

    - test error - errors on the final test set

- Train/ Test Skew (Schieflage)
- Learning:
    - Forward Pass
    - Backpropagation
        - adjusts weights of the network to descrease error rate (learning phase)

Sequence Models
---------------

One Hot Encoding
    - given vocabulariy V which contains all known/ possible words (0 indexed list)
    - word is encoded with "1" when the word is hit and "0" if not
    - Problem: semantics are missing/ not encoded

Distributed Representation
    - words get features attached like "age", "mÃ¤nnlich", "weiblich"...
    -> generated by neuraln network

Distributional Similarity
    - "My neighbour has **trees** in his yard."
    - "My neighbour has **bushes** in his yard."
    - represent word based on neighbouring word
    - "word embeddings"
    - word represenations are defined through their context
    - words appearing in similar context should have similar features

Model architecture
    - Word2Vec (only one hidden layer)


TODO softmax?
TODO what is regularisation?
TODO have a further play with facets
     tensor board
     definition of Tensor
     hyperparameter tuning
     linear/ logistic regression
